# 🛠️ Mac Dev Starter Kit

A modern CLI tool to automate and bootstrap your macOS development environment in minutes.

> Installs Git, Node (via NVM), code editors, terminal apps, browser tools, and more — all with one command.


## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Varadarajan-M/mac-dev-starter-kit/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

This will:

* Install NVM and the latest **LTS** version of Node.js
