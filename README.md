# 🛠️ Mac Dev Starter Kit

A modern CLI tool to automate and bootstrap your macOS development environment in minutes.

> Installs Git, Node (via NVM), code editors, terminal apps, browser tools, and more — all with one command.


## ⚡ Quickstart

If you already have **Homebrew** and **XCode Command Line Tools** installed, bootstrap your dev setup with:

```cmd
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaysrinivas333/windows-dev-starter-kit/main/bootstrap.ps1'))"
```

This will:

* Install NVM and the latest **LTS** version of Node.js

* Install dependencies
* Launch the interactive CLI setup
